		Remind the server to print out the directory list by sending data over.
		Create a new port as an int by receiving from the client socket.
		Create a new socket as IPv4 and as TCP.
		Now try to connect to the server by using the temporary port number.
		Create a buffer that will read in the entire data over.
		Now store all the data into the buffer.
