Set up the arguments by assigning the port number into the argument.

If server port number is not digit:
	Print "Port number not valid" and exit.
Else:
	Set server port number as int(server port number).
	
Set up the server socket as IPv4 and TCP format.
Bind the server port number to the socket.
Listen for one connection.
Have socket call accept() to the new connection socket and address.

#Continue to listen for user commands
while 1:
	If command is "ls":
		Open a new data socket connection.
		Display the directory list of files.
		Close the connection.
	If command is "quit":
		Break out of the while loop.
	If command is "put":
		Open a new data socket connection.
		try:
			Try to open the file as read-only.
		except:
			If file cannot be open, display error message.
		try:
			While there are still some bytes to read:
				Continuously send the bytes of data from the file.
		finally:
			Close the socket connection and the file.
			
	If command is "get":
		Open a new data socket connection.
		If the path exists for the file name:
			Set up a new .txt file with any name.
		Now open the file as write-only.
		While there are still some bytes to write:
			Continue to receive the number of bytes of data into the file.
		Close the file.
		Close the socket connection.
Close the connection socket.
