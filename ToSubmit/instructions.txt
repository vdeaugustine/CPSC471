How to run Python TCP Client/Server

Open the two terminals. Do the following steps in order:
1. In one terminal, type python <server filename>.py <port number>.
2. In the other terminal, type python <client filename>.py <server machine> <port number>.
Make sure that the number of arguments match or the program will not execute at all!
Also, be sure the port numbers of client and server match in order to perform a successful TCP connection.

Here are the following commands to use while running the FTP client:
get <filename> (download the file from the server)
put <filename> (upload the file to the server)
ls (list all the files in the server)
quit (disconnect connection from server and exit)
