How to execute:

Run server application:

python3 mserver.py <port number>

Run client application:

python mclient.py <address> <port number>

We have tested the program with 'localhost' as the address

Enter commands on client application

Enter quit to end the program



Notes: Program is not complete. We established a connection and communication between server and client sockets, accept user input, and begin running ls command, but were confronted with some bugs that were unable to be solved in time.
